# Node.JS Cards Against Humanity
This really has no use, I'm just a bit bored. NOTE: This probably won't get finished. I just have nothing better to do right now.

This fairy simple version of Cards against humanity uses the 
express.js & websocket libraries to allow (mostly) RESTful & real-time 
enjoyment of the amazing card game that is Cards Against Humanity
